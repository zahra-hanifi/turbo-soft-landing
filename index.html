                <p>
                    Our heavy-duty gas turbines are robust and flexible
                    engines, designed for large simple or combined cycle
                    power plants. They are suitable for peak, intermediate,
                    or base load duty, as well as for cogeneration applications.
                    Customers benefit from our extensive validation and testing
                    capabilities. All engines are proven in commercial operation
                    and provide outstanding efficiency

                    Our industrial gas turbine models with their compact and
                    rugged design make them an ideal choice for both industrial
                    power generation and mechanical drive applications.
                    They also perform well in decentralized power generation
                    applications. Their high steam-raising capabilities help achieve
                    overall plant efficiency of 80 percent or higher. They are proven
                    with more than 2,250 units sold at small utilities, independent
                    power producers, and in the oil and gas industry.
